The amygdala activates when you feel threatened, it's the primal part of the brain that's saved us from extinction.

Thinking of everyones BIPCEPS will help avoid awkward situations, and should help keep people in a safe state.

* Belonging - Sense of community. Threatening this in trials shows that physical pain indicators fire in the brain. No invite to team lunch etc
* Improvement/Progress - Sense of purpose, vision. Towards purpose or improving lives, learning etc.
* Choice - flexibility, autonomy. It's a balance.
* Equality - equal access for resources, time, compensation
* Predictably - Direction of work, time, challenges
* Significance - Do they have an effect? Can they move needles, are they visibility, do they get recognition

Moving desk is an example of a disruption that can threaten all of the needs above.

[.notes]

Kept coming up in different ways throughout the conference

Excellent piece by Nick Means about the story of Eiffel's tower.

1. Teach it to a child
+
Write out what you understand on a piece of paper, using words that can be understood by a child. In doing so you'll identify gaps in your knowledge. 
1. Review
+
Where you're unable to explain, go and research until you have a clearer picture in your mind, ignore jargon and understand in plain terms.
1. Organise and Simplify
+
Review your notes, and organise them into a simple narrative that can be read. Read it out loud. You may need to simplify it further.
1. Transmit
+
Once you're sure you understand something, then you can share this knowledge with another person, or group.

Whitney O'Banner talks about how teams often get caught up in defining Key Results to go with Objectives that are unmeasurable or unachievable. The first few times you should not worry about targetting metrics. The metrics may not even turn out to have any bearing on how successful the project is.

[[define-progression]]
== Defined Progression

Spend time to define progression

* Don't overload new starters

* Enable learning new skills
* Acknoledge levelling up
* Makers can multiple people

[.notes]

Both Pat Kua, and Melinda Seckington talk about career progression and tracking.

They both have different representations of what the progression looks like.

An idea:
* Produce a spreadsheet with names, skills "HTML", "CSS", "SQL" etc and rate skills
** Beginner ("I probably can't help you")
** Intermediate ("I can help you, if it's not too complicated")
** Experienced ("I'm confident I can help you")
* Define several "Tracks" of progression focusing on different aspects - assign them to roles.
* Define the shape of individuals using a radar chart
